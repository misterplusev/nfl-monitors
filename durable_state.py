"""Durable state for the MLB monitors.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The HuggingFace Space filesystem is EPHEMERAL. Free-tier Spaces have no
persistent volume (that is a paid add-on), so every deploy, every sleep/wake
and every crash-restart destroys /home/user/app/data in its entirety.

Two things broke because of that, both of them user-visible:

  1. DISCORD SPAM. Every monitor tracks what it has already announced in a
     plain in-memory dict (e.g. PitcherTracker.posted at
     mlb_pitcher_monitor_v003.py:355 — no load, no save). A restart empties it,
     so every game on the slate reads as "new" again and the whole slate is
     re-announced. This is the single largest source of duplicate posts.

  2. LOST EVIDENCE. The event log and preflight receipts live on the same
     disk, so deploying a fix destroys exactly the records needed to judge
     whether the fix worked.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
A private HuggingFace Dataset repo is used as the durable store. It is free,
versioned, and completely unaffected by container restarts. The Space already
carries an HF_TOKEN secret, so no new credential is required.

Deliberately implemented on `requests` alone, using HuggingFace's NDJSON commit
API, rather than pulling in `huggingface_hub`. Adding a dependency would force
an image rebuild on a runtime that is currently healthy; this module needs two
HTTP calls and is not worth that risk.

DESIGN RULES
------------
* Never raise. Every failure degrades to local-only behaviour, which is exactly
  today's behaviour, so this module can only improve reliability, never reduce
  it. A monitor must never die because a state push failed.
* Write locally first, always, and push remotely on a debounce. Each remote
  write is a git commit; saving per-game would produce ~15 commits per run and
  bloat the repo. Local writes stay instantaneous and authoritative within a
  process; the remote copy is what survives a restart.
* Prune on load. State is keyed by game_pk and only the recent window matters.
